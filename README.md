# Objective
Our objective of this project is to analyze tweets related to Netflix in order to analyze the trends of the ever popular streaming platform. Due to COVID-19, Netflix has seen more subscribers than ever before as people look to the platform as a major source of entertainment. We would like to see what people are saying on twitter about Netflix and the shows and movies offered by the platform. Some questions we can ask are: How has the brand image of Netflix changed over the years?  What shows and movies are receiving the most recognition? Is it positive or negative

# Obtaining Data
We will need to clean the data, since is a trending topic, the tweets have too many @ and # that maybe won't be helpful on our analysis, also we will extract the show â€˜s names to analyze the sentiment of each show and the overall polarity on the different opinions. 
We will search for keyphrases like #Netflix, #NetflixShows #NetflixOriginals, #NetflixandChill, #QuarantineandChill and analyze if the tweets obtained are positively or negatively related to Netflix.
